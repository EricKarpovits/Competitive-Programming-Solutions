**`Competitive Programming`** can certainly be tough. Stuck on a specific problem and not sure how to continue? Does reading the problem statement make you question your English comprehension skills? Well, you've come to the right place. When editorials aren't available, taking a peek at a solution can help overcome the wall you're currently facing.

Within this repository will contain my solutions from judges, including DM::OJ, as well as competitions, including various CCC, DMOPC, and Appleby. They might not be the most efficicent solutions but they all obtained the maximum points possible.
